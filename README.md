A collection of discord selfbot scripts that can automate many things. The scripts are called either through the command line ( requires tedious passing in all required arguments ) or
through a launcher that comes ready-made.
# CAUTION!
Selfboting is against discord TOS. So far I haven't received any action from discord on using any of the scripts on three accounts. However, it is still a risky thing to do. 
I am not responsible for what happens to your account. Be aware of the risks as you use these scripts.
# Installation
You need to have the following libraries installed beforehand:
```
pip install easygui
pip install selfcord
```
Download the latest release, which comes in zip format. Unextract in a folder of your choice.
You'll now have all the scripts in their separate folders, and a launcher to make use of them.
# Usage
Simply double click `launcher.py` Note that you need to have `easygui` installed beforehand as mentioned above. This will open up a bare-bones interface for using the script.
You will be asked for your discord token, which can be extracted from your web browser through a process I won't explain here. JUST GOOGLE IT.

Alternatively, you may also fill the `default_info.txt` file with your account token to avoid the hassle. 
Upon starting the program you will be asked whether you want to use the default token. This way you can switch accounts at ease.
